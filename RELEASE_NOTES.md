# Release Notes - BetterNexusMods v0.1.6

## New Features & Enhancements:

This version introduces several new features to enhance your Nexus Mods browsing experience. All features can be toggled on or off via the extension's popup menu.

*   **Hide Downloaded Mods:** Automatically hides mods that you have already downloaded, decluttering mod listings.
*   **Changelog on Hover:** Quickly view a mod's recent changelog by simply hovering over a designated icon or area (details may vary based on Nexus Mods page structure).
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** Seamlessly load more mods as you scroll down on mod listing pages, eliminating the need for pagination.
*   **Display Post Count:** Shows the number of posts (comments) directly on the mod tile or mod page, giving you a quick insight into community discussion.

We hope you enjoy these new improvements! Please report any issues or provide feedback through the extension's support channels.
